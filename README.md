# haiku-generator
=====

This haiku generator works by accessing a random string element from each of three different arrays.

Each string element is a different line to a haiku, with the first array consisting of strings with 
five syllables, the second array consisting of strings with seven syllables, and the third array 
consisting of strings with five syllables again.

The generator then concatenates each string element together to form a complete haiku.
